Release Notes:

Week 2: (11/08/22 - 11/15/22)

This week we focused on getting the infrastructure of our website put together. We fixed bugs involving initializing our docker file and database initialization, and now our web pages are loading the way we expect them to. We also created a bug-free branch to be ready for deployment in Lab 12.

New Features:
 - Created bug-free branch to prepare for deployment in Lab 12

Bug Fixes:
 - Docker file is now working (See docker-compose.yaml in ProjectCode/src)
 - Directory has been rearranged to work properly
 - Updated the message.ejs file and website loads correctly (See message.ejs in ProjectCode/src/views/partials)

Week 1: (10/27/22 - 11/03/22)

This week we focused on creating the structure of our database and writing our APIs. We ended up creating our pages as well with extra time that we had.

New Features:
 - Made a manual database (partial for now)
 - Created and populated the index.js file with required API's 
 - Made the ejs files for the different pages in our website
